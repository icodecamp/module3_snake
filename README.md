# module3_snake

Forked from the [snake-python](https://github.com/samertm/snake-python/graphs/contributors) project worked on by [samertm](https://github.com/samertm) and [DaveyPocket](https://github.com/DaveyPocket) 


This project contains three main files
  1. __game.py__ the game controller that initializes the game board and executes game play
  2. __snake.py__ the snake class that knows it's direction, location, score, and length
  3. __utils.py__ the utility class that contains helper methods for the controller
  
The project is not complete. The `move(self, input_direction)` function in snake.py is incomplete. The responsibility of this function is to take in a direction as an input (left, right, up, or down), and output will be the next coordinates of the "head" of the snake.
